Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Services.</p>
              
              <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including restricting access to your computer and/or account. Your username and password may not be used by any other person. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether with our Services or a third-party service.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. User Content</h3>
              <p>Some areas of the Services may allow users to submit, post, display, provide, upload, or otherwise make available content such as profile information, comments, questions, and other content or information (collectively, "User Content"). User Content may be viewable by other users of the Services and through third-party websites. As such, any User Content may be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. All User Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom it originated, and you access all such information and User Content at your own risk.</p>
              
              <p>We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours. However, by providing or sharing User Content through the Services, you agree to allow others to view, edit, share, and/or interact with your User Content in accordance with your settings and these Terms. We have the right (but not the obligation), in our sole discretion, to remove any User Content that is shared via the Services.</p>
              
              <p>By submitting, posting, displaying, providing, uploading, or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Services, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to us a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Services and our (and our successors' and affiliates') business, including for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services in any media formats and channels. You also grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive right to access your User Content through the Services and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under these Terms. You waive all moral rights in your User Content and warrant that moral rights have not otherwise been asserted in your User Content. You will not be entitled to compensation from us if we use your User Content or if your name, likeness, or voice is used in connection with the Services.</p>
              
              <p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that: (a) you have the written consent of each identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such person's name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use; (b) you have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents required by law to post any User Content relating to third parties; and (c) your User Content and our use thereof will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights and privacy rights.</p>
              
              <p>To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information you provide to us is truthful and accurate.</p>
              
              <p>We have the right, in our sole discretion, to: (a) edit, redact, or otherwise change any User Content; (b) re-categorize any User Content to place it in more appropriate locations on the Services; and (c) pre-screen or delete any User Content at any time and for any reason, without notice.</p>
              
              <p>We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Content, including its accuracy, validity, timeliness, completeness, reliability, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness, or safety, or any intellectual property rights therein, that you or any other user or third party posts, sends, or makes available via the Services. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing, sharing, or making it available via the Services. You agree that we act only as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that we shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content.</p>
              
              <p>Although we reserve the right to review and remove any content or User Content that violates these Terms, our Community Guidelines, or the law, we do not necessarily review all of it. We also cannot guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact while using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Interactions with Other Users</h3>
              <p>If the Services permit interaction with other users, you are solely responsible for such interactions. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users. We shall have no liability for your interactions with other users or for any user's action or inaction.</p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Moderators</h3>
              <p>Some areas of the Services may allow you and/or other users to serve as unofficial, voluntary moderators of User Content on the Services ("Moderators"). We are not responsible for actions taken by Moderators. We reserve the right to revoke or limit your ability to serve as a Moderator at any time and for any or no reason, including for breach of these Terms.</p>
              
              <p>If you elect to become a Moderator, you agree to: (a) comply with the Moderation Handbook (if applicable); (b) take appropriate action to remove or restrict User Content that violates these Terms or the Community Guidelines and escalate issues accordingly; (c) not perform moderation activities in return for compensation from a third party; (d) protect the confidentiality of any non-public information you access as a Moderator; (e) not represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of us; and (f) not enter into agreements with third parties on behalf of us.</p>
              
              <p>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a Moderator if we, in our sole discretion, believe that such action or decision is not in the interest of Presidency Solutions or its community.</p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Acceptable Use</h3>

              <p>You agree not to post User Content that: (a) may create a risk of harm, loss, injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or illness to you, any other person, or any animal; (b) may create a risk of loss or damage to any person or property; (c) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content or asking for personally identifiable details; (d) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (e) contains unlawful, harmful, abusive, offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive, harassing, threatening, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; (f) contains illegal content; (g) contains content you do not have the right to make available under law or contractual relationships; (h) disparages or harms Presidency Solutions or the Services; or (i) contains inaccurate or outdated information.

By granting access, you agree that we may access, store, and make available any content from your Third-Party Provider Account ("Social Media Content") through the Services, including friend or connection lists. Personally identifiable information from your Third-Party Provider Accounts may be available through your Services account, depending on your privacy settings.
